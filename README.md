# Deloitte X Luiss 

The scope of this project is to detect the effect of an advertising campaign. In particular, the case refers to an e-
commerce of perfumes that after running an advertising campaign wants to analyse the results. The advertising
campaign started on 2019 December 3rd and ended on 2019 December 24th, so it was run only for few days,
but it is fundamental to quantify the impact it has had in order to be able to launch a massive advertising
campaign later on.
The starting point of case is a fact that is immediately apparent: there is a significant peak in website visits
in the December 2019. Before jump to any conclusions, it is necessary to analyse the elements that are not so
obvious making a more in-depth analysis focused on the historical trends and the companyâ€™s behaviour in the
last years. Hence, the main request of this project is to quantify the impact of the advertising campaign on
sales by analyzing the website and online purchases performances.
